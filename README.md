# boids — 3D movement rules → ecological patterns → prediction

**Status (2026-10-27): exploratory research repository.** This repository centralizes the 3D Boids simulations, ecological niche partition analyses, cross-repository synthesis, synthetic forecasting benchmarks, and observed bat movement-transition feasibility test from the research sessions of 2026-10-25–26.

**日本語要約：** 3D Boidsの分離・整列・凝集と、資源消費・環境追跡・個体履歴を結合し、種内／種間ニッチ分化の数理指標と予測を検証する研究リポジトリ。*合成モデルによる予測成功と、実測データで検証された運動法則を混同しない。*

## Current evidence, in order of strength

1. **Synthetic mechanism / known-truth (v1–v3).** Agent-based trajectories produce persistent individual vertical-profile differences, spatial versus vertical partition contrasts, local environmental-state buffering, and breeding-component concentration under specified parameters. A surrogate predictor performs better than simple baselines at unseen combinations drawn from the same synthetic model. These are **not wild-species forecasts**.
2. **Observed Tadarida benchmark (v4).** Archived bat GPS summaries support a small positive held-out next-climb-class gain from prior climb class (M1−M0 ≈ **+0.01383 nats/transition**, equal-individual mean, 7/8 positive). Adding annotated wind gives **−0.00113**; adding other-night individual history does **not** pass label-permutation calibration (**p=0.32**). These outcomes do not establish or refute the biological causes of individuality.
3. **Known-truth GPS-error identifiability (v5).** An independent *synthetic negative control* demonstrates that previous-climb-class forecast gains can arise solely from shared altitude measurement error even when true successive climb velocities are independent. This does not establish the error magnitude for actual tagged bats or refute a true movement policy. See [`docs/GPS_ALTITUDE_ERROR_IDENTIFIABILITY_V5.md`](docs/GPS_ALTITUDE_ERROR_IDENTIFIABILITY_V5.md).
4. **Independent public bat-pair 3D forecast (v6, exploratory).** A separately published, checksum-verified 30-flight-pair archive supplied 28 eligible paired 3D trajectories under a frozen structural gate. Whole-pair held-out actual-partner versus mismatched-ghost mean MSE gain was +0.000555 (pair-bootstrap 95% CI [-0.000092,+0.001276]); 16/28 pairs favored the actual partner. **The planned forecast advantage was not supported**, and these brief spline-resampled flight episodes do not identify social-force coefficients or persistent 3D niches. See [v6 result](docs/OBSERVED_BAT_PAIR_RESULT_V6.md).
5. **Full Boids social-force estimation remains unidentifiable from the original Tadarida source.** Approximate archived GPS observations provided no cross-individual fix pairs both within five seconds and within 100 metres; the sampling cadence and localization error are not suitable for estimating short-range separation/alignment/cohesion coefficients. The original raw-data checksum was **not independently reverified in the local run**; no raw GPS tracks are redistributed here.

## Reproduce without raw animal records

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cd boids3d_empirical_v4
python -m unittest discover -s boids3d_research -p 'test_*.py' -v  # 24 tests
python -m unittest discover -p 'test_*.py' -v                 # 4 tests
cd boids3d_research
python predict_niche.py --help
cd ../..
PYTHONPATH=boids3d_empirical_v4:validation_v5 python -m unittest discover -s validation_v5 -p 'test_*.py' -v  # 6 tests
python validation_v5/altitude_error_audit.py --seeds 30 --out validation_v5/results/gps_altitude_error_known_truth_v5.json
```

The observed-data numerical benchmark requires the original Movebank source. Follow [`boids3d_empirical_v4/README.md`](boids3d_empirical_v4/README.md) and its explicit MD5 gate. Avoid claiming raw-data re-execution from the bundled aggregates alone.

## Independent 3D paired-flight forecast (v6)

The [predeclared experiment and source eligibility](docs/INDEPENDENT_3D_SOURCE_AND_FORECAST_V6.md) is completed. [GitHub Actions run 40277563862](https://github.com/zuizui0223/boids/actions/runs/40277563862) passed all checks; the result and the figure are committed in `validation_v6/results/`. Reproduce source validation and held-out prediction by running the predeclared workflow; the downloaded original bat recordings remain separate from this repository.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=validation_v6 python -m unittest discover -s validation_v6 -p 'test_*.py' -v
python validation_v6/paired_trajectory_gate.py --out validation_v6/results/paired_eligibility.json
python validation_v6/social_forecast.py --out validation_v6/results/bat_pair_directional_forecast.json
```

**Claim limit:** non-significant directional forecasting improvement is not evidence of no acoustic influence, and spline-derived 30-Hz computational spacing is not independently observed 30-Hz localization. No same-source model or threshold rescue is authorized after opening outcomes.

## Observed pigeon forecast v8 and inverse-law caution v9

The **197 matched pigeon flights** from [Zenodo 5010830](https://zenodo.org/records/5010830) were evaluated under a frozen **10 bird-connected group** holdout. The *prespecified primary* current-partner vs 10-second-stale-partner gain was **+0.00008669 rad² MSE** (95% bird-group bootstrap interval **[-0.00003237,+0.00021788]**, **6/10** groups positive, one-sided exact sign p=**0.377**). **Not supported**. Present-partner vs own-only was a secondary positive contrast: **+0.00031012 rad²** and 9/10 positive groups, but that does not identify unique social forces. This is **horizontal next-turn prediction**, not a fitted 3D niche or a cross-species forecast.

- [v9 audit and movement-to-niche theory](docs/MOVEMENT_TO_NICHE_IDENTIFIABILITY_V9.md): exact replay of group-weighted original result, plus a **synthetic identified-set counterexample**. At a fixed calibration distance, distinct separation/cohesion coefficients predict the same instantaneous force. At new spacing, they produce different long-horizon motion. This is mathematical *known truth*, not a wild-animal ecological observation.
- `validation_v9/` contains **12 new regression tests**, offline replay, known-truth equations, result JSON and plots. The [CI workflow](.github/workflows/receipt-consistency-v9.yml) does not redownload raw GPS.

**No post-hoc rescue of v6 or v8 primary predictive failures is authorized.** The next ecological validation needs independent multiday 3D trajectories, calibrated observation errors and source-blind distribution-level forecasts.

## v10: from ambiguous Boids coefficients to 3D niche and individual-profile predictions

**Synthetic mathematics, not field validation.** [v10 ecological report](docs/NICHE_IDENTIFIED_SET_V10.md) and [20 regression tests](validation_v10/) propagate five source-equivalent separation/cohesion candidate pairs through two-species, twelve-agent stochastic 3D use simulations. Each parameter candidate has identical instantaneous social force at the stipulated 10-m source spacing.

- In shared synthetic resources, the coarse-grid vertical information is **0.573–0.605 nats** and horizontal species information is **0.0011–0.0014 nats** across candidates; after imposed spatial resource reassembly the respective ranges are **0.006–0.012** and **0.596–0.651**. The dominant niche axis switches under all tested rules and remains consistent on a finer grain. This is **by construction of toy environmental selection targets**, not observed competition.
- Across ten stochastic simulation holdouts, a stable per-agent vertical target produces an individual self-versus-species conditional-height log-score gain of **+0.158 nats/fix**; reassigning these targets between agent labels across seeds gives **−0.065** at the representative alpha=1.0. This illustrates a sufficient mechanism for profile persistence and does not prove bat memory.
- Precise categorical probability maps are **not identical** across candidate rules. The 4×4×4 shared-resource source-world candidate-pair joint TV reaches **0.0255**, increasing to **0.0430** for the reassembled resource world (7×7×7 grain up to **0.0791**). These are finite candidate-set spreads, **not statistical confidence intervals or complete identified-set bounds**.

The known-truth simulations contain no measured habitat, competitive resource depletion, calibrated GPS error, or wild-animal individual identities. Frozen v6/v8 wild movement primary failures remain unchanged.

## v11: Separating imposed resource targets from Boids-generated niche-axis organization

The [v11 driver-ablation report](docs/RESOURCE_AND_SOCIAL_DRIVER_ABLATION_V11.md) compares **social on versus off under common simulation noise**, with no pseudo-species environmental target contrast, vertical targets, horizontal targets, and both. Same-target species information is nearly zero; strong horizontal/vertical partitions persist with social interactions removed. Thus the previously reported species-axis switch is mostly **by imposed habitat target design**, not spontaneous niche partition produced by Boids alone.

Boids itself modifies the *distribution of an existing habitat-driven difference*: in the two-contrast synthetic world, the coarse-grid alpha=1.0 social intervention changes I(S;XY) by **−0.1055 nats** and I(S;Z|XY) by **+0.0743 nats**, with matching signs at fine grain but different magnitudes. Individual z-profile identity falls from **0.2721** to **0.0353 nats** when the prescribed role-specific z-target is eliminated with social on; this is not evidence of naturally arising bat individuality.

The independent-seed forward comparison favors the **correct known target environmental world** over an environment-blind baseline; it is a synthetic Monte Carlo oracle, **not a new observed habitat or cross-species prediction**. All 3D state-use results are categorical occupancy of invented coordinates, not realized feeding-niche proof or field competition inference. Original negative v6 and v8 tests remain frozen.
